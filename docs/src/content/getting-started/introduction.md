## Install

```
npm i kavi zod
```

## What is Kavi?

Kavi makes it easy to create typesafe APIs in SvelteKit. SvelteKit unfortunately don't support typesafe APIs yet, which is why Kavi was created.

Kavi is a simple, typesafe, and lightweight alternative to SvelteKits api routes. Kavi handles both `+page.server.ts`, `+page.ts` and `+page.svelte` files seamlessly.
